Arberia Theme is a clean and responsive Hugo theme for tecnical teachers, engineers and tutorial youtubers. At least I think this since I thought this theme for my blog. But of course you can use it for whatever you want.

The [demo](https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/) includes a lot of documentation about Installation, Features with a few more stuff. Make sure you visit it, to get an awesome hands-on experience and get to know about the features (working progress this is an alfa version readme)...
